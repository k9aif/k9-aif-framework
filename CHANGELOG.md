## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-31

### Added

- **`K9EventRouter`** (`k9_core/router/k9_event_router.py`) — OOB Kafka-aware router. Single entry point for all events. Routes deterministically via `routing.table` config; falls back to `intent.in` topic when `event_type` is unknown.
- **`IntentOrchestrator`** (`k9_orchestrators/intent_orchestrator.py`) — OOB Kafka-decoupled intent resolution orchestrator. Consumes `intent.in`, runs `IntentSquad` + `K9IntentAgent` to classify intent, then re-publishes to the correct domain topic or sends a "please clarify" response to `responses.out`.
- **`K9EventBus.publish_to(topic, event)`** — multi-topic publish support for Router and IntentOrchestrator.
- **`routing:` config section** in `k9_aif_abb/config/config.yaml` — defines `intent_topic`, `response_topic`, `confidence_threshold`, and routing `table`.
- **`examples/k9routing/`** — working example demonstrating all three routing outcomes (deterministic, LLM-resolved, clarification) and two SBB override patterns (`ConfigListIntentAgent`, `AcmeIntentOrchestrator`). Runs without Kafka or LLM.

### Changed

- **`config.yaml`** — all hardcoded IPs, credentials, and endpoints replaced with `${ENV_VAR:-default}` placeholders (`POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `KAFKA_BROKER`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `DOCLING_ENDPOINT`).
- **`config_loader.py`** — added `load_dotenv()` so `.env` is automatically applied before config expansion. No code changes required in calling code.
- **`BaseIntentAgent`** and **`IntentSquad`** docstrings corrected — removed "pre-router" terminology; both components are internal to `IntentOrchestrator`, not wired in front of the Router.
- **`orchestrators.yaml`** — replaced obsolete demo stubs with `IntentOrchestrator` entry.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** and **`README.md`** — execution hierarchy updated to reflect Router as the single entry point and `IntentOrchestrator` as a Kafka-decoupled consumer.

### Removed

- **`FrameworkOrchestrator`** — demo stub that never invoked a squad; removed to avoid misleading SBB implementors.
- **`GovernanceOrchestrator`** — demo stub with the same issue; removed.
